          The cloud migration project aims to help the client vacate their data center by 2027. The systems currently hosted on-premises are primarily based on Windows and .NET tech stacks. My role is to leverage the existing enterprise platform to migrate the clientâ€™s workloads to the cloud. Given the complexity involved, the project has been divided into different phases to gradually move workloads to the cloud. Throughout this project, we utilized various tools to assist with delivery, including Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Codefresh, Artifactory, Bamboo, New Relic, and Splunk.

          Migrating on-premises workloads to AWS with moderate replatforming of legacy applications. One of the biggest challenges of this project was convincing stakeholders to shift their 'on-premises' mindset and embrace modern practices. We conducted regular workshops to upskill the team and worked closely with them throughout the migration. Ultimately, we raised the team's cloud skill level, enabling them to operate and maintain cloud workloads independently after the project was completed.

          This was a short engagement that involved bootstrapping Azure accounts using Servian's custom solutions (Terraform & Azure DevOps) to lay the foundation for the client's data pipelines. The work primarily focused on two areas: setting up the environment and pipelines, and upskilling the client's engineers so they could maintain the solution independently.

          Designed and implemented a custom solution using AWS networks and services to connect on-premises IBM AIX systems to third-party systems. The solution, built with ELB, Cognito, and AWS PrivateLink, was a secure proxy running in AWS that handled connection requests between on-premises and third-party systems. The chosen Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool was AWS CloudFormation, which was the standard in the client's organization. The custom solution also included integration with the client's Azure Active Directory for user authentication via AWS Cognito.
