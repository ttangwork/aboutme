          Cloud migration project to help client vacate their data centre by 2027. The systems hosted on-premises are mainly based on Windows and .NET tech stacks. It's my job to leverage existing enterprise platform and tools to migrate client's workloads into cloud. Given the complexity involved, the project was constructed in different phases to move workloads into cloud gradually. During this project, a lot of tools were used: Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Codefresh, Artifactory, Bamboo, New Relic & Splunk.

          Migrating on-prem workloads into AWS with moderate replatform of legacy applications. One of the biggest challenges of this project was to convince stakeholders to shift their "on-premises" mindset and embrace modern practice. We run regular workshops to upskill the team as well as working with them closely during the migration. We ended up raising the cloud skill level for the team which was able to operate and maintain cloud workloads independently after we wrapped up the project.

          This was a short engagement which involves bootstraping of Azure accounts using Servian custom solutions (Terraform & Azure DevOps) to lay the foundation for client's data pipelines. The work was mainly on two parts: setting up the environment and pipelines; and upskilling client's engineers so they can maintain the solution independently.

          Designed and implemented a custom solution using AWS network and services to connect on-premises IBM AIX systems to third-party systems. The solution, built by ELB, Cognito and AWS Private Link, was a secured proxy running in AWS that handled connection requests between on-premises and the third-party systems. Choice of IaC was AWS CloudFormation which was the standard IaC tool in client's organisation. The custom solution also involves integration with client's Azure Active Directory for user authentication via AWS Cognito.
